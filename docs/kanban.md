## To Do ‚úÖ

### [TTT-2] Preload store from the localstorage

Populate redux store from local storage. Save the data from the store to localstorage.

### [TTT-3] Add links to Jira on task id

Recognize Jira task id (DX1-DDDD) and transform them into links. Keep in mind that task id can have other number of digits, e.g. DX1-21, DX1-2, DX1-3312, etc. Assume max number of digits to 5. For a started Jira instance url can be hardcoded. Preferably use regex patterns for that. In [TTT-4] user will be able to customize those links and patterns.

### [TTT-4] Customize Jira link instance and task pattern

Create a settings view where use can customize link to Jira instance and task pattern, e.g. not "DX1-2131" but "UTF-1231". Preferably use regex patterns for that.
